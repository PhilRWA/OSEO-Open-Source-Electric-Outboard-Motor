# Open-Source-Electric-Outboard-Motor
A simple 3d printed electric outboard motor for small boats.

This project is aiming to create a simple easy to assemble relatively high power and budget friendly electric outboard primarily for cruising yacht tenders and small dinghys. It is currently based around a VESC speed controller and a 6374 electric skateboard motor. 

The aims are to use cheap easy to obtain parts to create something that can compete with the torqueedo travel series of electric motors and certainly outperform cheaper trolling motors. Most parts are 3d printed with the exception of the transom mount and main shaft/ control arm which are made of 28mm and 22mm pole respectively. This means that unless you already have a 3d printer or know someone who does this project will become considerably more expensive. I'm printing all of the parts on my stock Ender 3 v2 in PETG without any issues.

I'm not planning to add much complexity to the electronics side of things if I can avoid it to keep things as accessible as possible for all people interested in building one of these. Although who knows, I'm sure it would be possible to add things like displays, gps speedometers, nav lights, and many other parts if you wanted to modify the design somewhat.

Currently I'm powering the system with a 36v ebike battery, which is cheap and easy to obtain, but this does have a drawback of only being able to supply around 1/3 of the wattage that the motor can handle. This is still around 900w which is 50% more power than the torqueedo travel I believe, so I'm hoping it will still perform well, and you can unlock more performance by either building or buying a battery capable of supplying a higher continuous current. I wil be designing a dedicated battery pack for this at some stage, but first I need to build one and confirm my theories work.

Currently the estimated cost for the project (assuming you already have a 3d printer) is around £400 including the 36v e bike battery, which is a pretty attractive option given a torqueedo is around £1500 last time I checked.

So I'll be hopefully updating here as things progress, and I will update on performance as soon as I can get around to building the version 1. If anyone wants to send me any suggestions or ideas for improvements or things that I have overlooked feel free to mention it on here.
